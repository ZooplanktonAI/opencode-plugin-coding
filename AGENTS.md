# AGENTS.md — opencode-plugin-coding

Project knowledge base for agents working on this repository.

## What This Repo Is

A shared OpenCode plugin that provides multi-agent software development workflows (brainstorm, plan, orchestrate, review, debug) for ZooplanktonAI projects. It is NOT an application — it contains markdown skills, guides, and a JS plugin entry point that dynamically registers agents.

## Key Conventions

### File types

All content files are markdown (`.md`). The only JS file is the plugin entry point at `.opencode/plugins/opencode-plugin-coding.js`. There is no build step.

### Naming

- **Config fields:** camelCase (`coreCoder`, `coreReviewers`, `testDrivenDevelopment`, `reviewFocus`)
- **Agent names:** kebab-case, descriptive of role (e.g., `core-coder`, `core-reviewer-primary`, `reviewer-glm`)
- **Agent names may reflect model identity** when it aids clarity (e.g., `reviewer-glm`, `reviewer-deepseek`). The name is free-form — the model is set separately in `workflow.json` → `agents` → `{ name, model }`.
- **Command names:** prefixed with `zooplankton-coding-` to avoid colliding with OpenCode built-ins

### Agent architecture

Agents are **dynamically registered** by the plugin JS via OpenCode's `config.agent` API. There are no `.opencode/agents/*.md` files in consumer projects. The plugin reads:

1. **workflow.json** → `agents` section for `{ name, model }` definitions
2. **guides/*.md** for prompt content (used as the agent's `prompt` field)
3. **Hardcoded permission maps** in the plugin JS (matching the source of truth table below)

This means:
- To add/remove agents or change models, edit `workflow.json` and restart OpenCode
- Guide changes take effect immediately (no per-project files to update)
- Permissions are controlled centrally in the plugin

### Agent permissions (source of truth)

| Role | edit | bash | read | webfetch |
|------|------|------|------|----------|
| core-coder | allow | `'*': allow` | allow | allow |
| core-reviewer | deny | `'*': allow` | allow | deny |
| normal reviewer | deny | `'*': deny` + `gh` allowlist | allow | deny |
| security reviewer | deny | `'*': deny` + `gh` allowlist | allow | deny |

Normal/security reviewer `gh` allowlist: `gh api *`, `gh pr diff *`, `gh pr view *`, `gh pr checks *`.

### Plugin mechanism

The plugin uses OpenCode's `config` hook (undocumented but confirmed in OpenCode source) to:
1. Add `skills/` to `config.skills.paths` for skill discovery
2. Register commands from `commands/*.md` into `config.command`
3. Register agents from `workflow.json` + `guides/*.md` into `config.agent`

No symlinks are used. Consumer projects install via `"plugin"` array in `opencode.json`.

### workflow.json

Each consumer project has `.opencode/workflow.json` with project-specific settings. The `agents` section stores `{ name, model }` objects. The plugin reads these to dynamically register agents with the correct model, permissions (from role), and prompt (from guide file).

## Gotchas

- **`package.json` main** points to `.opencode/plugins/opencode-plugin-coding.js` — this is intentional for the plugin system, not a mistake.
- **The orchestrate skill is the largest file** (~430 lines). When editing, be careful with the phase structure. Use targeted edits, not full rewrites.
- **`.opencode/reviewer-knowledge.json`** is gitignored and ephemeral. Accept loss on fresh clone.
- **Plan/retrospective files** are gitignored. Only completed plans >7 days old are auto-deleted; stale non-completed plans trigger alerts.
- **Use `<<'EOF'` (single-quoted)** in heredocs within skill/guide bash examples to prevent shell variable expansion inside JSON.
- **No agent `.md` files in consumer projects** — agents are registered dynamically. If you see references to `.opencode/agents/*.md` in consumer projects, those are stale artifacts from before the architecture change.
- **Session reuse across review rounds** — the orchestrate skill recommends passing `task_id` to resume reviewer sessions across rounds, so reviewers retain context. If a resumed session fails, fall back to a fresh session.
- **Orchestrate smoke test** — to validate the full orchestrate flow in this repo, see `doc/SMOKE_TEST.md`. Use a trivial change (e.g., docs tweak) and run all 5 phases. Note that this repo has no build/lint/test/typecheck commands configured in `.opencode/workflow.json`, so verification steps will report "N/A — not configured."

## Review Focus

When reviewing changes to this repo:
- Verify cross-file references (command names, config field names, agent names, guide paths)
- Check that plugin JS permission maps match the permission table above
- Ensure workflow.json template and self-hosted config use `{ name, model }` objects
- Confirm guide files are self-consistent with skills that reference them
